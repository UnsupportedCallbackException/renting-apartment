Bolshchikov\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nWe all need place to live. Here, in Israel, real estate market is kinda a big bubble. The prices on 2-3 bedroom apartments in the center of the country skyrocketed within last 10 years. So for many of us, it is challenging to own place, sometimes it’s even unnecessary. That's why, renting an apartment is the way to go.\r\n\r\nIsrael is a great country, but like in other places, everything is not completely straight forward as you wish it would, especially in real estate.\r\nThe purpose of this guide is to walk you, dear reader, thru the stages that you would need to take in order to get your place. The path, in general, is simple: \r\n\r\n1. Extensive search of your options\r\n2. Visiting variants\r\n3. Signing the contract\r\n4. Moving in\r\n\r\nHowever, there are many stones under the current. \r\nSo, sit tight, let’s dive in.\r\n\r\n## Content\r\n1. Prerequisites\r\n2. Searching\r\n3. Visiting\r\n4. Signing\r\n5. Moving\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n> TL;DR\r\n\r\n1. Decide what you want\r\n2. Check book\r\n3. Co-signer\r\n4. Internet\r\n5. Facebook account\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you need to define variants that you would be looking for. The more precise you can describe what you want, the less options you would have to go thru. Decide how many rooms you need (in Israel, it’s not American style, 2 rooms apartment means 1 bedroom apartment), with or without furniture, with or without pets, and, of course, choose the location. It might be not so easy. Israel is a small country, so you can easily live in one city, work in another one, and drive just 20 minutes. For example, if you work in Herzliya, you may consider apartment in Herzliya itself if you don’t have a car, or in Kfar Saba, Raanana, Hod-HaSharon, Tel Aviv if you do. \r\n\r\nWhat else do you need to have prepared in advance? Definitely, a bank check book. You will use it to pay for the apartment, so, make sure to have 15 spare checks there. Think of somebody who can co-sign the lease contract with you. Lastly, have laptop with Internet and Facebook account :)\r\n\r\n## Searching\r\n> TL;DR\r\n\r\n1. Search private ads\r\n2. Search facebook ads\r\n3. Call and ask question\r\n4. Google the neighborhood\r\n5. Set the visiting date\r\n\r\nAs I've stated in the prerequisites part, the more you can specify you search criteria, the easier the search will be. Everything matters: location, neighborhood, price, furniture, parking, square meters, pictures, etc. For example, setting the lower limit of square meters (meaning you are not willing to consider apartments less than, let's say, 50 meters) might reduce your search results by 20%. I would also recommend considering ads only with pictures and prices (yad2 has those options). This will automatically filter results from some garbage.\r\n\r\nYou can conduct the search either by yourself with private ads and with real estate representative. I, personally, prefer the former approach. The majority of real estate brokers usually don't care about your needs. They are sellers, closers. They are ready to persuade you in anything only that you would take a lease and pay them a fee which equals to one month payment to the apartment. \r\n\r\nNow, where to search? Well, first of all, Israeli sites with private ads:\r\n\r\n1. [Yad2](http://www.yad2.co.il/Nadlan/rent.php)\r\n2. [Homeless](http://www.homeless.co.il/rent/)\r\n3. [WinWin](http://www.winwin.co.il/RealEstate/ForRent/RealEstatePage.aspx)\r\n4. [City Market](http://www.ctmarket.co.il/%D7%A0%D7%9B%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%9B%D7%A8%D7%94/)\r\n\r\nThe second type of resource is [Facebook](http://facebook.com). It has so many different groups about apartments search and rental that you can't imagine. For example, [Secret Haifa Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/445887735495943/) or [Secret Tel Aviv Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/). Find groups that correspond to your location, and keep track of their posts. Something will pop up that you like, for sure.\r\n\r\nWhenever you see the variant that you like, do not hesitate, call right away and ask questions. \r\n\r\nAsk whether the posted pictures are real. Yes, I know, it might sound absurd, but there are many people who are posting pictures of another flat from the same building. Real estate agencies do that quite often. \r\n\r\nAsk whether the price includes anything like arnona[1], water, etc. If no, then what's the price of arnona and vaad bait[2]. \r\n\r\nAsk the exact address, then go and look at it on [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com) and the street view mode. See the neighborhood that it's not some kind of slums. \r\n\r\nAt the end, set the date and time when you can come and see the apartment.\r\n\r\n## Visiting\r\n> TL;DR\r\n\r\n1. Form your opinion about the apartment, landlord.\r\n2. Ask as many questions as you can.\r\n3. Write the first check.\r\n4. Don't sign the contract.\r\n\r\n*Always come with money or a check. Keep reading to know why.*\r\n\r\nDuring the visiting, pay attention to everything. Basically, you need to form an opinion about 3 things: neighborhood, apartment itself, and your future landlord.\r\n\r\n#### Neighborhood\r\n* Look around in neighborhood, how clean it is.\r\n* How dangerous it might b at night.\r\n* See where the closest grocery stores are.\r\n* Ask about neighbors, whether they are quite.\r\n\r\n#### Apartment\r\n* Pay attention to whether the apartment is divided or not. It is a common practice in Israel to take a normal apartment and spilt it in 2 or even 4 parts, and then rent each of them separately for the price of regular apartment.\r\n* Pay close attention to windows and ceilings.\r\n* Think whether you have enough  space for all you furniture (in case you have any), or what else you might need to buy.\r\n* Ask about the process of paying bills.\r\n\r\n#### Landlord\r\nForming an opinion about the landlord might be the hardest task of all. You need to realize that kind a person he/she is, such that she wouldn't give you a hard time in future. Ideally, the good owner is the one that you mostly don't hear from, but helpful when something needs to be taken care of.\r\n\r\n* Ask the owner what her/she do for a living.\r\n* Ask about previous habitants of the apartment and what they did.\r\n\r\nThus, you can build a psychological portrait about the landlord and about habitants that he/she expects in her apartment.\r\n\r\nIf you like the apartment and thinking of taking it, do not hesitate - write **the check of serious intentions**. Usually, it is a payment for the first month. You are doing it for the owner to stop the search of other habitants to make sure that it won't be gone to other people in several hours. I'm not kidding about this part. The apartment search is very competitive, especially in central districts around Tel Aviv. The next candidate, who comes after you to see the apartment, might take it. If the owner offers you to sign the contract right away, do **NOT** do it. The check of intention should be enough to show that you are serious. Take a copy of lease contract to study at home.\r\n\r\n## Signing\r\n> TL;DR\r\n\r\n1. Study carefully\r\n2. Write checks\r\n\r\nUsually, the lease contracts in Israel are standard, but, anyway, study it very carefully before you sign it. Consult with your friends and/or a lawyer. The rent contract is signed for a year, so pay attention to the conditions of breaking before its termination date. Either you should find somebody instead of you or pay a fine. Check the condition of using the security check[3].\r\n\r\nPrepare all checks:\r\n\r\n* 11 checks for monthly payment (the first one you've already gave during the visiting part)\r\n* Check for the electricity\r\n* Check for the water\r\n* Security check\r\n\r\nLast three checks are usually given to the landlord for insurance purposes. For example, if you don't pay the bills for the electricity or water, the landlord can use whose checks to pay instead of you. In case, you cause some serious damage to the apartment (e.g. set it on fire), the security check might be used.\r\n\r\nGet the keys.\r\n\r\n## Moving\r\n> TL;DR\r\n\r\n1. Update address\r\n\r\nProbably, the most pleasurable as well as the most exhausting part. Set up the Internet and update your address in all places where it might show up. Here's a minimal list that you might find useful.\r\n\r\n* Ministry of internal affairs\r\n* Work\r\n* Kupat holim\r\n* Bank\r\n* Insurance company\r\n* Internet provider\r\n\r\n## Dictionary\r\n1. **Arnona**: the land tax that is paid to the local municipality from every property\r\n2. **Vaad bait**: the payment for the house maintenance, e.g. cleaning.\r\n3. **Security check**: is the payment in the form of check that is given to the landlord. This check can be used in defined circumstances. Usually, in case, you've made a significant damage to the apartment.\r\n","google":"UA-51300293-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
