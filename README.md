# The Ultimate Guide of Renting an Apartment in Israel

> Author: Sergey N. Bolshchikov

## Introduction
We all need place to live. Here, in Israel, real estate market is kinda a big bubble. The prices on 2-3 bedroom apartments in the center of the country skyrocketed within last 10 years. So for many of us, it is challenging to own place, sometimes it’s even unnecessary. So, renting an apartment is the way to go.
Israel is a great country, but like in other places, everything is not completely straight forward as you wish it would, especially in renting the real estate.
The purpose of this guide is to walk you, dear reader, thru the stages that you would need to take in order to get your place. The path is, in general, not complicated: 

1. Extensive search of your options
2. Visiting variants
3. Signing the contract
4. Moving in

However, there are many stones under the current. 
So, sit tight, let’s dive in.


## Prerequisites
> TL;DR

1. Decide what you want
2. Cheque book
3. Co-signer
4. Internet
5. Facebook account

First of all, you need to define variants that you would be looking for. The more precise you can describe what you want, the less options you would have to go thru. Decide how many rooms you need (in Israel, it’s not American style, 2 rooms apartment means 1 bedroom apartment), with or without furniture, with or without pets, and, of course, choose the location. It might be not so easy. Israel is a small country, so you can easily live in one city, work in another one, and drive just 20 minutes. For example, if you work in Herzliya, you may consider apartment in Herzliya itself if you don’t have a car, or in Kfar Saba, Raanana, Hod-HaSharon, Tel Aviv if you do. 
What else do you need to have prepared in advance? Definitely, a bank cheque book. You will use it to pay for the apartment, so, make sure to have 15 spare cheques there. Think of somebody who can co-sign the lease contract with you. Lastly, have laptop with internet and facebook account :)
