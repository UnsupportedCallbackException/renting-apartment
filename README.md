# The Ultimate Guide of Renting an Apartment in Israel

> Author: Sergey N. Bolshchikov

## Introduction
We all need place to live. Here, in Israel, real estate market is kinda a big bubble. The prices on 2-3 bedroom apartments in the center of the country skyrocketed within last 10 years. So for many of us, it is challenging to own place, sometimes it’s even unnecessary. That's why, renting an apartment is the way to go.

Israel is a great country, but like in other places, everything is not completely straight forward as you wish it would, especially in renting the real estate.
The purpose of this guide is to walk you, dear reader, thru the stages that you would need to take in order to get your place. The path is, in general, not complicated: 

1. Extensive search of your options
2. Visiting variants
3. Signing the contract
4. Moving in

However, there are many stones under the current. 
So, sit tight, let’s dive in.

## Prerequisites
> TL;DR

1. Decide what you want
2. Cheque book
3. Co-signer
4. Internet
5. Facebook account

First of all, you need to define variants that you would be looking for. The more precise you can describe what you want, the less options you would have to go thru. Decide how many rooms you need (in Israel, it’s not American style, 2 rooms apartment means 1 bedroom apartment), with or without furniture, with or without pets, and, of course, choose the location. It might be not so easy. Israel is a small country, so you can easily live in one city, work in another one, and drive just 20 minutes. For example, if you work in Herzliya, you may consider apartment in Herzliya itself if you don’t have a car, or in Kfar Saba, Raanana, Hod-HaSharon, Tel Aviv if you do. 

What else do you need to have prepared in advance? Definitely, a bank cheque book. You will use it to pay for the apartment, so, make sure to have 15 spare cheques there. Think of somebody who can co-sign the lease contract with you. Lastly, have laptop with Internet and Facebook account :)

## Searching
> TL;DR

1. Search private ads
2. Serach facebook ads
3. Call and ask question
4. Google the neighborhood
5. Set the visiting date

As I've stated in the prerequisites part, the more you can specify you search criteria, the easier the search will be. Everything matters: location, neighborhood, price, furniture, parking, square meters, pictures, etc. For example, setting the lower limit of square meters (meaning you are not willing to consider apartments less than, let's say, 50 meters) might reduce your search results by 20%. I would also recommend considering ads only with pictures and prices (yad2 has those options). This will automatically filter results from some garbage.

You can conduct the search either by yourself with private ads and with real estate representative. I, personally, prefer the former approach. The majority of real estate brokers usually don't care about your needs. They are sellers, closers. They are ready to persuade you in anything only that you would take a lease and pay them a fee which equals to one month payment to the apartment. 

Now, where to search? Well, first of all, Israeli sites with private ads:

1. [Yad2](http://www.yad2.co.il/Nadlan/rent.php)
2. [Homeless](http://www.homeless.co.il/rent/)
3. [WinWin](http://www.winwin.co.il/RealEstate/ForRent/RealEstatePage.aspx)
4. [City Market](http://www.ctmarket.co.il/%D7%A0%D7%9B%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%9B%D7%A8%D7%94/)

The second type of resource is [Facebook](http://facebook.com).  It has so many different groups about apartments search and rental that you can't imagine. For example, [Secret Haifa Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/445887735495943/) or [Secret Tel Aviv Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/secrettelaviv/). Find that corresponds to your location, and keep track of its posts. Something will pop up that you like for sure.

Whenever you see the variant that you like, do not hesitate, call right away and ask questions. 

Ask whether the posted pictures are real. Yes, I know, it might sound absurd, but there are many people who are posting pictures of another flat from the same building. Real estate agencies do that quite often. 

Ask whether the price includes anything like arnona[1], water, etc. If no, then what's the price of arnona and vaad bait[2]. 

Ask the exact address, then go and look at it on [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com) and the street view mode. See the neighborhood that it's not some kind of slums. 

At the end, set the date and time when you can come and see the apartment.

## Dictionary
1. **Arnona**: the land tax that is paiyed to the local municipality from every property
2. **Vaad bait**: the payment for the house maintenance, e.g. cleaning.
